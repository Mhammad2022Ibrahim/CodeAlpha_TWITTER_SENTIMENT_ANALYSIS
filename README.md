# CodeAlpha_TWITTER_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS

# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

## Overview:
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets into either racist/sexist or non-racist/sexist categories. It covers data preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques like "Bag-of-Words" and "TF-IDF", and building predictive models using various classifiers.

# Contents:
## Data Cleaning:
Removing Twitter handles, special characters, and short words.
Tokenization and stemming of tweets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Generating wordclouds to visualize common words.
Analyzing hashtag trends in tweets based on sentiments.

## Feature Extraction:
Creating Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF features from cleaned tweets.

## Model Building:
Utilizing "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Support Vector Machine", and "XGBoost classifiers".
Evaluating model performance metrics like "F1 Score", "Accuracy", "Precision", and "Recall".

## Instructions for Running the Notebook:
Ensure the necessary libraries are imported using the provided code snippets.
Read the data from the CSV files and follow the data preprocessing steps.
Execute the code cells sequentially for "tokenization", "stemming", and "story generation".
Visualize common words and hashtags for analysis.
Extract features using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF methods.
Build and evaluate sentiment analysis models with different classifiers.

## Additional Information:
The notebook contains detailed code snippets, explanations, and visualizations for each step.
Make sure to have the required packages installed to run the notebook successfully.
Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different models for enhanced results.
